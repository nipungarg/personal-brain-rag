Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can access data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

Key concepts include supervised learning (learning from labeled examples), unsupervised learning (finding structure in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (learning through trial and error with rewards). Common techniques include neural networks, decision trees, and support vector machines. The field has applications in image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles.
